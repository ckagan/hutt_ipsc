Mapping eQTLs with GEMMA in 73 Hutterite iPSCs


Data - genotpyes (imputed and genotyped from Ober lab), expression data from 73 iPSC feeder-free cell lines (Illumina ht12v4 arrays)

Conversion of PRIMAL imputed genotypes:
CGI python pipeline http://www.completegenomics.com/analysis-tools/toolrepository/varFileSNPstoPLINKconverter/
Did not work even with zcat file
